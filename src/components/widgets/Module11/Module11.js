          <p>
            Marketplaces connect consumers with what they want: rides, food,
            accommodation, and more. Your payments should meet the same high
            standards as your product experience: with just a tap, Stripe helps
            sellers on your marketplace get paid.

                  With over 700,000 drivers providing nearly one million rides
                  per day, Lyft uses Stripe to power payments at scale. Lyft
                  also partnered with Stripe to build Express Pay, a
                  first-of-its-kind feature that allows drivers to cash out
                  whenever they want, instantly.

            Payments for marketplaces used to be hard: accounting for seller
            earnings, paying out multiple parties, managing 1099-Ks, tax
            reporting, and regulatory compliance. Marketplaces shouldnâ€™t have to
            build all that from scratch, so we made{" "}

            to provide all the tools you need to run a multi-sided marketplace.
