Using Stripe, they also built a new monthly giving program, which makes it even easier for subscribers to donate throughout the year.</p>

		            <p>Payments for marketplaces used to be hard: accounting for seller earnings, paying out multiple parties, managing 1099-Ks, tax reporting, and regulatory compliance. Marketplaces shouldnâ€™t have to build all that from scratch, so we made <a className={style.commonLink} href="#">Stripe Connect</a> to provide all the tools you need to run a multi-sided marketplace.</p>
				</div>
				<div className={style.marketplacesGalleryBottomContentRight}>
					<p>Integrating Connect means always having access to state-of-the-art technology. Attract and retain more sellers with instant payouts, accept payments across all channels, and expand to 30+ countries with a single integration.</p>
