            <p>
              Marketplaces connect consumers with what they want: rides, food,
              accommodation, and more. Your payments should meet the same high
              standards as your product experience: with just a tap, Stripe
              helps sellers on your marketplace get paid.

                    charity: water optimized their mobile and web donation flows
                    with Stripe so they can focus on what really matters:
                    bringing clean water to every person on the planet. Using
                    Stripe, they also built a new monthly giving program, which
                    makes it even easier for subscribers to donate throughout
                    the year.

              Payments for marketplaces used to be hard: accounting for seller
              earnings, paying out multiple parties, managing 1099-Ks, tax
              reporting, and regulatory compliance. Marketplaces shouldnâ€™t have
              to build all that from scratch, so we made{" "}
              <a className="common-link" href="#">
                Stripe Connect
              </a>{" "}
              to provide all the tools you need to run a multi-sided
              marketplace.
