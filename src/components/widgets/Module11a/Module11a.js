          <p>
            Marketplaces connect consumers with what they want: rides, food,
            accommodation, and more. Your payments should meet the same high
            standards as your product experience: with just a tap, Stripe helps
            sellers on your marketplace get paid.

                  charity: water optimized their mobile and web donation flows
                  with Stripe so they can focus on what really matters: bringing
                  clean water to every person on the planet. Using Stripe, they
                  also built a new monthly giving program, which makes it even
                  easier for subscribers to donate throughout the year.

            Payments for marketplaces used to be hard: accounting for seller
            earnings, paying out multiple parties, managing 1099-Ks, tax
            reporting, and regulatory compliance. Marketplaces shouldnâ€™t have to
            build all that from scratch, so we made{" "}
            <a styleName="common-link" href="#">
              Stripe Connect
            </a>{" "}
            to provide all the tools you need to run a multi-sided marketplace.
